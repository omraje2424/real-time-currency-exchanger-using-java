# Currency Converter 2

## Overview
**CurrencyConverter2** is a real-time currency exchange calculator that allows users to convert between various global currencies. The application includes fees for foreign transactions and currency conversions, and it stores the conversion data in a MySQL database. It is built using Java Swing for the user interface, with live data fetched from the Exchange Rate API.

## Features
- Converts between numerous currencies (over 100 available).
- Calculates and displays foreign transaction fees (2%) and currency conversion fees (1%).
- Displays a final amount after deducting fees.
- Stores each conversion transaction into a MySQL database with detailed information about the original amount, converted amount, and fees.

## Requirements
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- MySQL database server
- Internet connection for fetching real-time exchange rates from [Exchange Rate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)

## Technologies Used
- Java Swing for the GUI
- MySQL for storing conversion data
- REST API integration using `HttpURLConnection` for fetching exchange rates
- JDBC for database connectivity

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/omraje2424/CurrencyConverter2.git
```

### 2. Database Setup
Create a MySQL database and a table for storing conversion data:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE currency_converter1;

USE currency_converter1;

CREATE TABLE conversions1 (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  amount DOUBLE NOT NULL,
  from_currency VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  to_currency VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  converted_amount DOUBLE NOT NULL,
  foreign_transaction_fee DOUBLE NOT NULL,
  conversion_fee DOUBLE NOT NULL,
  total_fees DOUBLE NOT NULL,
  final_amount DOUBLE NOT NULL,
  conversion_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 3. Update Database Configuration
In the `CurrencyConverter2` class, update the following credentials for your MySQL database:
```java
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/currency_converter1";
String user = "root";
String password = "Morya@123";  // Replace with your MySQL password
```

### 4. Run the Application
Compile and run the Java program from your IDE or using the command line:
```bash
javac CurrencyConverter2.java
java CurrencyConverter2
```

## How to Use
1. Enter the amount you want to convert.
2. Select the source currency ("From Currency") and the target currency ("To Currency").
3. Click the **Convert** button.
4. The application will display the converted amount, along with the fees and the final amount after deductions.
5. Conversion data will be stored in the MySQL database.
